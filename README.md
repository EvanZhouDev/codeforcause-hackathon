# CH20

This project was built by [EvanZhouDev](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev) and [ThatXliner](https://github.com/ThatXliner) during the 12-hour [Code For Cause 2023 Hackathon](https://codeforcause.devpost.com), for the BISV DECA Attendance track. We won [first place overall](https://devpost.com/software/deca-attendance). The last commit made during the Hackathon [can be found here](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/codeforcause-hackathon/commit/04ca898acd6f1993f3b03aa4a287b89114955d32).

Since the DECA team at BASIS Independent Silicon Valley plan to actually use the app (and ThatXliner's [FRC Team 3256](https://github.com/Team3256) might as well), further development will be done at [EvanZhouDev/Zyma](https://github.com/EvanZhouDev/zyma).

The name of the app was randomly selected as "Carbohydrates" by [ThatXliner](https://github.com/ThatXliner) for no particular reason, but was later adapted to be CH20 as a nod to **C**ode for Cause **H**ackathon **20**23.
